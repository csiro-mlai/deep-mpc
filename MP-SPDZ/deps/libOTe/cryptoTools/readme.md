=====


CryptoTools is a portable c++14 library containing a collection of tools for building cryptographic protocols. This include asynchronous networking (Boost Asio), several fast primitives such as AES (AES-NI), Blake2 (assembly), and eliptic curve crypto (Relic-Toolkit, Miracl, or libsodium). There are also several other utilities tailored for implementing protocols.

Thirdparty networking is also supported. See `frontend_cryptoTools/tutorial/Network.cpp` for an example.
  

 

## Build
 
The library is *cross platform* and has been tested on Windows, Mac and Linux. 
There is one mandatory dependency on [Boost 1.75](http://www.boost.org/) (networking),
and **optional dependency** on
[Relic](https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic). CMake 3.15+ is required and the build script assumes python 3.
 

```
git clone https://github.com/ladnir/cryptoTools
cd cryptoTools
python build.py --setup --boost --relic
python build.py -- -D ENABLE_RELIC=ON
```
It is possible to build only the protocol(s) that are desired via cmake command. In addition, if boost and or relic are already installed, then `boost` or `relic` can be ommitted from `python build.py setup boost relic`.

See the output of `python build.py` or `cmake .` for available compile options. For example, 
```
python build.py -- -D ENABLE_SSE=OFF
```
will build without SSE instrisics. Argument after the `--` are forwarded to cmake.

The main executable with examples is `frontend` and is located in the build directory, eg `out/build/linux/frontend/frontend_cryptoTools, out/build/x64-Release/frontend/Release/frontend_cryptoTools.exe` depending on the OS. 

**Enabling/Disabling dependancies:**
 * The library can be built without Relic as
```
python build.py --setup --boost
python build.py -- -D -D ENABLE_RELIC=OFF
```
 * The library can be built without Boost as
```
python build.py --setup --relic
python build.py -- -D -D ENABLE_BOOST=OFF
```
 

## Install

cryptoTools can be installed and linked the same way as other cmake project. By default the dependancies are not installed. To install then, run the following
```
python build.py --setup --boost --relic --install
```
You can also provide and install location by specifying `--install=path/to/installation`.

The main library is similarly installed as
```
python build.py --install 
```

By default, sudo is not used. If installation requires sudo access, then call
```
python build.py --install --sudo
```
See `python build.py --help` for full details.


## Linking
cryptoTools can be linked via cmake as
```
find_package(cryptoTools REQUIRED)

target_link_libraries(myProject oc::cryptoTools)
```
Other exposed targets are `oc::tests_cryptoTools`. In addition, cmake variables `cryptoTools_LIB, cryptoTools_INC, ENABLE_XXX` will be defined when found, where `XXX` is one of the cryptoTools options.

To ensure that cmake can find cryptoTools, you can either install cryptoTools or build it locally and include cryptoTools in the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` variable or provide its location as a cmake `HINTS`.
